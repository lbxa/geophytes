# Who We Are

Geophyte is a non-governmental organisation working to create a mindset that
establishes a synchronous relationship between the environment and its inhabitants
dependent on the mining industry. Our priority is to uplift these communities and help
them unlock their innate potential, fostering independence from the mining industry.

# Our Name

A geophyte (geo = earth, phyte = plant or growth) is a plant with an underground storage
organ, like many Australian native plants. This storage organ contains reserves of
carbohydrates and water and helps the plant survive adverse environmental conditions
such as cold, drought or even fires. Like our namesake, we aim to nurture the hidden
potential within communities, helping them build resilience and thrive even in
challenging circumstances.

# What We Are Doing

Utilising the medium of media, with a focus on creating discussion, and changing climate perspectives through grassroots initiatives.

# Mission Statement

Empower mining-dependent communities by cultivating sustainable alternatives,
fostering resilience, and nurturing local potential for long-term prosperity.

# Vision

We envision a world where former mining communities thrive as beacons of sustainable
development, demonstrating the power of local ingenuity and environmental
stewardship.

# We Advocate

At Geophyte, we advocate for:

1. Sustainable economic diversification in mining-dependent regions
2. Education and skills training programs tailored to local needs and opportunities
3. Environmental restoration and protection in post-mining landscapes
4. Policies that support community-led development initiatives
5. Increased investment in renewable energy and green technologies
6. Preservation of local cultures and traditional knowledge
7. Equitable distribution of resources and opportunities within communities

# We Work

Our work at Geophyte involves:

- Collaborating with local leaders and stakeholders to identify community needs and aspirations
- Advocating for policy changes that support community resilience and sustainable development

# Our Approach

Geophyte employs a holistic, community-driven approach to development. We believe
that sustainable change comes from within communities themselves. Our role is to
facilitate, support, and amplify local initiatives through a strengths-based approach.
