title: Our Name
---

A geophyte (geo = earth, phyte = plant or growth) is a plant with an underground storage
organ, like many Australian native plants. This storage organ contains reserves of
carbohydrates and water and helps the plant survive adverse environmental conditions
such as cold, drought or even fires. Like our namesake, we aim to nurture the hidden
potential within communities, helping them build resilience and thrive even in
challenging circumstances.
