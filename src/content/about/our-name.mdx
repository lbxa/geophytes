title: Our Name
---

A geophyte (geo = earth, phyte = plant) is a plant with an underground storage organ, like many Australian native plants. This storage organ helps the plant survive adverse environmental conditions such as cold, drought or even fires. Like our namesake, we aim to nurture the potential within communities, to build resilience and thrive even in challenging circumstances.
